# Telecommunication Billing Data Pipeline
This project focuses on unit testing for a telecommunication billing data pipeline. The data pipeline is responsible for extracting data from a CSV file, performing transformations using pandas, and storing the transformed data in another CSV file. The goal is to develop robust unit tests for the functions in the data pipeline using the unittest framework.
